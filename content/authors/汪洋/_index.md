东南大学研究生

A graduate student at Southeast University.My research direction is the study on the allocation methods of elderly care service facilities based on regional population characteristics. I have participated in many surveys of elderly care service facilities. In terms of life, I like playing table tennis, but I am rather quiet and introverted in personality.
