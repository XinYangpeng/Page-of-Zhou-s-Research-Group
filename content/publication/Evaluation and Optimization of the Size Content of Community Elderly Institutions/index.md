abstract: The number of individuals in China who are in urgent need of long-term care as they age has reached a significant population. In response to this situation, China has established a significant number of elderly care institutions. However, there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of such facilities. Previous studies have frequently concentrated on individual case analysis or the examination of institutional household types, yet they have largely overlooked the influence of the number and proportion of elderly individuals and their living standards on the scale and scope of services provided by neighboring elderly institutions. The article employs a case study approach, focusing on 32 neighborhoods in Qinhuai District, Nanjing, China, within the Qinhong Street. The study aims to: (1) examine the current distribution of community elderly care institutions, (2) utilize Python to crawl network data, conduct community information collection, and employ other methods to gather information about the elderly population. The number of households and housing prices of the neighborhood are used as units of analysis. Principal component analysis is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data, thereby extracting four types of integrated elderly living standards and the number of elderly people in the area. The influencing factors were identified and visualized using ArcGis, and the data were graded using the quartile method. The establishment of three types of demand grades in terms of population and living standard provides a scientific theoretical basis for the setting of facility grades of community-based elderly care organizations.
